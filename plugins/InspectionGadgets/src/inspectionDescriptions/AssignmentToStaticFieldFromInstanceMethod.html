Reports any assignments to <code>static</code> fields from within
instance methods, including increments and decrements.
While legal, such assignments are tricky to do
safely, and are often a result of fields being inadvertently marked
<code>static</code>.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    void increment() {
      // Warning: updating a static field
      // from an instance method
      count++;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
