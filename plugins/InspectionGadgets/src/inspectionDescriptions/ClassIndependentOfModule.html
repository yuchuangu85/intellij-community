Reports any class in module which:
<ul>
  <li>doesn't depend on any other class in this module</li>
  <li>is not a dependency for any other class in this module</li>
</ul>
Such classes are an indication of ad-hoc or incoherent modularisation strategies,
and may often profitably be moved.
<p>
  Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
  <em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
