Reports the non-short-circuit forms of boolean operators 'and' and 'or' ( <code>&</code>
and <code>|</code> ). The non-short-circuit versions are occasionally useful, but
their presence is often due to typos of the short-circuit forms ( <code>&&</code>
and <code>||</code> ), and may lead to subtle bugs.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
if (a & b) {}
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
if (a && b) {}
</pre>
