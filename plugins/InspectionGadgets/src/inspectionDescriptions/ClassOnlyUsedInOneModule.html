<ul>
  <li>doesn't depend on any other class in this module</li>
  <li>depends on classes from another module</li>
  <li>is a dependency only for some classes from this other module</li>
</ul>
<p>

  Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
  <em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
