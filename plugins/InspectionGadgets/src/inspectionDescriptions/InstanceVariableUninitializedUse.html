Reports instance variables which are read prior to initialization. Equality checks with <code>null</code> are ignored by this inspection.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    int bar;

    Foo() {
      System.out.println(bar);
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>
Note: this inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report instance variables as uninitialized incorrectly. Variables
  reported as initialized will always be initialized.
