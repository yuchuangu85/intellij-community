Reports the usage of <code>Collection.toArray()</code> calls depending on different styles, and suggests applying the preferred style.
<p>
  There are two styles to convert a collection to an array: either using a pre-sized array
  (like <code>c.toArray(new String[c.size()])</code>) or using an empty array (like
  <code>c.toArray(new String[0])</code>.
  In older Java versions using pre-sized array was recommended, as the reflection
  call which is necessary to create an array of proper size was quite slow.
  However since late updates of OpenJDK 6 this call was intrinsified, making
  the performance of the empty array version the same and sometimes even better, compared
  to the pre-sized version. Also passing pre-sized array is dangerous for a concurrent or
  synchronized collection as a data race is possible between the <code>size</code> and <code>toArray</code>
  call which may result in extra nulls at the end of the array, if the collection was concurrently
  shrunk during the operation.
