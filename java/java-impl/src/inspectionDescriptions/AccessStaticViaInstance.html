<p>Shows references to static methods and fields via a class instance rather than a class itself. While
  allowed by Java Language Specification, referring to static members via instance variables makes the
  code confusing as the reader may think that the result of the method depends on the instance.</p>
<p>Quick-fix replaces the instance variable with the class name.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  String s1 = s.valueOf(0);
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  String s = String.valueOf(0);
</pre>
