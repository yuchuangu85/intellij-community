Reports any non-empty packages which are present in multiple modules.
<p>
For example, you may have modules <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> in your program with same package <code>foo</code>.
Such modules cannot be used together because of a package conflict.
<p>
  Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
  <em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
