Reports class being named identically to one of their
super classes (but different in fully qualified name). Such class name may be very confusing.
<p>
  <b>Example:</b>
  <pre><code>
  package util;
  abstract class Iterable&lt;T&gt; implements java.lang.Iterable&lt;T&gt; {}
</code></pre>
<p>Quick-fix to rename the class is suggested only in the editor.</p>
