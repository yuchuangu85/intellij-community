Reports "no-op" methods in <code>abstract</code> classes. It is usually a better
design to make such methods <code>abstract</code> themselves, so that classes which inherit the methods will not forget to provide
their own implementations.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  abstract class Test {
    protected void doTest() {
    }
  }
</pre>
