Reports methods being named identically to the superclass of the method's class.
Such a method name may be confusing. 
This inspection doesn't consider interfaces or superclasses deep in the hierarchy. 
<p><b>Example:</b>
  <pre>
  <code>
    class Parent {}
    class Child extends Parent {
       public Parent Parent() {
         return null;
       }    
    }
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Quick-fix to rename the method is suggested only in the editor.</p>
