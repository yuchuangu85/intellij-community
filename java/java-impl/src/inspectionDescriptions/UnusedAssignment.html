Reports the cases where a variable is redundant as its value is never used after its assignment.<br>
If the variable is unused, it's better to remove it to shorten the code and to avoid redundant allocations.
<p>So the following cases are reported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the variable never gets read after assignment</li>
  <li>the value is always overwritten with another assignment before the next variable read</li>
  <li>the variable initializer is redundant (for one of the above two reasons)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection report about redundant initializers:
</p>
<pre>
  int getI() {
    int i = 0; // redundant initialization
    i = 2;
    return i;
  }
</pre>
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to have this inspection report about the cases when <code>++i</code> expression
may be replaced with <code>i + 1</code> one:
</p>
<pre>
  int preInc(int i) {
    int res = i;
    return ++res;
  }
</pre>
<p>
Use the third checkbox below to have this inspection report about the cases when the result of <code>i++</code> expression
is not used later:
</p>
<pre>
  int postInc(int i) {
    int res = i;
    return res++;
  }
</pre>
