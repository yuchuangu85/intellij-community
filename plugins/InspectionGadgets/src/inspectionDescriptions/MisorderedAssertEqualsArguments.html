Reports calls to <b>assertEquals()</b> which have the expected argument and the actual argument in the wrong order.
For JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 the correct order is <code>(expected, actual)</code>. For Junit 5 and TestNG the correct order is <code>(actual, expected)</code>
Such calls will behave fine for assertions which pass, but may give confusing error reports on failure.
