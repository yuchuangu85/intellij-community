Reports any <code>interface</code> that may be annotated as <code>@FunctionalInterface</code>, which is available in JDK 1.8.
Annotating <code>interface</code> with <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> can be useful to indicate that <code>interface</code>
is supposed to be functional and further <code>abstract</code> methods can not be added to it.
