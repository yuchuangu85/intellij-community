Reports annotations with <code>SOURCE</code> or <code>CLASS</code> retention policy when they are supposed to be used by JUnit 5.
Note, that if retention policy is not specified, then the default retention policy <code>CLASS</code> is used.
Such annotations are not available at runtime and most probably their retention policy should be fixed to be accessible via reflection. 
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  @Testable
  public @interface UnitTest {}
</pre>
<p>After the quickfix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @Testable
  public @interface UnitTest {}
</pre>
