Reports calls to assertion methods where the “expected” and “actual” arguments are of incompatible types.
Such calls often indicate that there is a bug in the test.
This inspection checks the relevant JUnit, TestNG as well as AssertJ methods.
<p>Examples:
<pre>
  assertEquals("1", 1);
  assertNotSame(new int[0], 0);

  // weak warning, may just test the equals() contract
  assertThat(foo).as("user type").isNotEqualTo(bar);
</pre>
