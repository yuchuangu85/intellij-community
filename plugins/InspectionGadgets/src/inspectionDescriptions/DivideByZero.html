Reports division by zero or remainder by zero.
In this case user will get <code>Nan</code> for doubles/floats and <code>ArithmeticException</code> for integers.
Note, that the divisor is not necessarily zero literal, but expression which statically known to be evaluated as zero.
The fix will suggest replacing division expression with <code>NaN</code> constant for floating point types.
