Reports static method calls where the call is qualified
by a subclass of the declaring class, rather than the declaring class itself. 
Java allows such qualification for classes, but such calls
may be confusing, and may indicate a subtle confusion of inheritance and overriding.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>class Parent {
  public static void print(String str) {}
}
class Child extends Parent {}
Child.print("Hello, world!");
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied: <code>Parent.print("Hello, world!");</code></p>
