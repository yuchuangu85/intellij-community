Reports empty methods which are probably good to be removed. Methods considered empty if they are empty itself and if they are overridden or
 implemented by empty methods only. Note that methods containing only comments and the <code>super()</code> call with own parameters are
 also considered empty.
<p>The inspection ignores methods with the special annotations, for example, EJB annotations <code>javax.ejb.Init</code> and <code>javax.ejb.Remove</code>.</p>
<p>The quick-fix tries to safely remove the unnecessary methods.</p>

<p>Use the settings below to set methods with the comments as non empty or to configure additional annotations.</p>
