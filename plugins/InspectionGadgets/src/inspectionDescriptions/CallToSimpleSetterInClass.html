Reports any calls to a simple property setter from within the property's class.
A simple property setter is defined as one which simply assigns the value of its parameter to a field,
and does no other calculation. Such simple setter calls may be safely inlined.
Some coding standards also suggest against the use of simple setters for code clarity
reasons.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo {
  private int index;
  public Foo(int idx) {
     setIndex(idx);
  }
  public void setIndex(int idx) {
     index = idx;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo {
  private int index;
  public Foo(int idx) {
    index = idx;
  }
  public void setIndex(int idx) {
    index = idx;
  }
}
</code></pre>

Use the first option below to only report on setter calls on <code>this</code> not on objects of the same type passed in as a parameter. 
<p>
Use the second option below to only report when the setter is <code>private</code>.
