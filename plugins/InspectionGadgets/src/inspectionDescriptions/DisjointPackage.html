Reports any packages whose classes can be separated into mutually independent subsets.
Such disjoint packages are a symptom of ad-hoc packaging, and may indicate a lack of conceptual cohesion.
<p>
  Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
  <em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
