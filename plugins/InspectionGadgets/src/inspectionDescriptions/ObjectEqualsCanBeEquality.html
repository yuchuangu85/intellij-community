Reports calls to <code>equals()</code> which can be replaced by <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> expressions without a change in semantics.
These calls can be replaced when they are used to compare <code>final</code> classes which don't have their own <code>equals()</code> implementation,
but use the default <code>Object.equals()</code>.
This may result in better performance.
There is a separate inspection for <code>equals()</code> calls on <code>enum</code> values: 'equals()' called on Enum value.
