Reports same named methods in the same class when they also have the same number of parameters. 
Such overloads may be very confusing, as it can be not clear which overload gets called.
<p><b>Example:</b>
  <pre><code>
  class Main {
    public static void execute(Runnable r) {}
    public static &lt;T&gt; void execute(RunnableFuture&lt;T&gt; c) {}
  }
</code></pre>

Use the checkbox below to ignore overloaded methods whose parameter types are definitely incompatible.
