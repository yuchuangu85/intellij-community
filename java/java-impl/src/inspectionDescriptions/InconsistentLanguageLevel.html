This inspection lists modules which depend on other modules with higher language level. 
Such dependencies should be broken off or current module language level should be increased.
<p>
  Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
  <em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
