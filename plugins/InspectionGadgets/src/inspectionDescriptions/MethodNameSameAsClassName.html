Reports methods being named identically to their class.
While such a naming is allowed by Java language, it's usually a mistake 
and it was intended to create a constructor. If it was intentionally named like this,
it's almost always a bad practice.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class MyClass {
    int val;

    // Method MyClass named identically to its containing class.
    // Likely, 'void' was added by mistake.
    void MyClass(int val) {
      this.val = val;
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>When possible, a quick-fix is provided to convert the method to a constructor:</p>
<pre>
  class MyClass {
    int val;

    MyClass(int val) {
      this.val = val;
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>Another quick-fix is provided to rename the method.</p>
