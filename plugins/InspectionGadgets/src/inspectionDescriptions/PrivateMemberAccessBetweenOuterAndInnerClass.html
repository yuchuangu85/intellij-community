Reports references to non-constant <code>private</code> members of a different class,
for which javac will generate a package-private synthetic accessor method.
Such methods may compromise security, because members appearing to be private, will in fact be accessible from the entire package.
<p>
An inner class and its containing class are compiled to separate
class files. The Java virtual machine normally prohibits access from a class to private fields and methods of
another class. To enable access from an inner class to private members of a
containing class or the other way around javac creates a package-private
synthetic accessor method.
By making the <code>private</code> member package-private instead, the actual accessibility is made explicit.
This also saves a little bit of memory, which may improve performance in resource constrained environments.
<p>
This inspection does not report anything if language level is set to Java 11 or higher
as thanks to nest-based access control (JEP 181), accessor methods are not generated anymore.
<p>Example:
<pre><code>
  class Outer {
    private void x() {}

    class Inner {
      void y() {
        x();
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick fix is applied the result looks like:
<pre><code>
  class Outer {
    void x() {}

    class Inner {
      void y() {
        x();
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>
