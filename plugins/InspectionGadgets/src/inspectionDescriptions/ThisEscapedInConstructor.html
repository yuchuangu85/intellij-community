Reports possible escapes of <code>this</code> during object construction. Escapes occur when <code>this</code> is used as a method argument
or the object of an assignment in a constructor or initializer. Such escapes may result in subtle bugs, as the object is now available in a
context in which it is not guaranteed to be initialized.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    {
      System.out.println(this);
    }
  }
</pre>
