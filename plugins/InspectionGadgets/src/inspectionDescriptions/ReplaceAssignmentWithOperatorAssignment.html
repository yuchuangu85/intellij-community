Reports assignment operations which can be replaced by operator-assignment. Code
using operator assignment is shorter and may be clearer.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
  x = x + 3;
  x = x / 3;
</pre>
<p>After the quick fix is applied the result looks like:
<pre>
  x += 3;
  x /= 3;
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the checkbox below to ignore the conditional operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
and <code>||</code>. Replacing conditional operators with operator
assignment modifies the semantics of the expression.
