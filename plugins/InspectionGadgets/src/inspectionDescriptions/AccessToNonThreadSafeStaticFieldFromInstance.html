Reports access to <code>static</code> fields that are of a non-thread-safe type.
When this access is from an instance field or a non-synchronized block,
it is possible that the static field is accessed from multiple threads.
This can lead to unspecified side effects, like exceptions and incorrect results.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class C {
    private static final SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
    String m() {
      return df.format("");
    }
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the table below to specify which types are not thread-safe.
Only fields with these exact types or initialized with these exact types are reported,
because there may exist thread-safe subclasses of these types.
