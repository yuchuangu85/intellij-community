Reports methods that have too many statements. 
Methods that have too many statements may be confusing, and are a good sign that refactoring is necessary.
<p>
  Note: all statements except the following are counted:
<ul>
  <li>empty statements (semicolon)</li>
  <li>block statements</li>
  <li>for loop initialization statement i.e. in <code>for(int i = ...;...)</code>
    statement <code>int i = ...</code> is not counted</li>
  <li>for loop update statement i.e. in <code>for(int i = ...;...; i += 2)</code>
    statement <code>i += 2</code> is not counted</li>
</ul>
