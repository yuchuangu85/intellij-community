Reports calls to <code>System.runFinalizersOnExit()</code>.
This call is one of the most dangerous in the Java language. It is inherently non-thread-safe,
may result in data corruption, deadlock, and may affect parts of the program far removed from its call point.
It is deprecated, and its use is strongly discouraged.
