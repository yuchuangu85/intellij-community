Reports varargs methods with the same name as other methods in the class or in a superclass.
Overloaded methods which take a variable number of arguments can be very confusing,
as it is often not clear which overloading gets called.
<p><b>Example:</b>
  <pre><code>
    public void execute(Runnable... r) {} // warning
    public void execute(Runnable r1, Runnable r2) {}
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
