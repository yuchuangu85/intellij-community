Reports <code>static</code> variables which are not guaranteed to be initialized upon class initialization.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    public static int bar;

    static { }
  }
</pre>
Note: this inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report static variables
as uninitialized incorrectly. Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.
