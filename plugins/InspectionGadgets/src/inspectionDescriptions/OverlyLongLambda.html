Reports lambda expressions that are too long.
Lambda expressions that are too long may be confusing, and it is often better to extract the statements into their own method.
<p>
Note: all statements except the following are counted:
<ul>
  <li>empty statements (semicolon)</li>
  <li>block statements</li>
  <li>for loop initialization statement i.e. in <code>for(int i = ...;...)</code>
      statement <code>int i = ...</code> is not counted</li>
  <li>for loop update statement i.e. in <code>for(int i = ...;...; i += 2)</code> 
      statement <code>i += 2</code> is not counted</li>
</ul>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the field below to specify the maximum number of statements a lambda expression is allowed to have.
