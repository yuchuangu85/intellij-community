Reports usages of API which isn't available at the configured language level. API availability is defined
by the version specified in the <code>@since</code> tag in its documentation. This may be useful because
language level can differ from your project SDK and it is possible that there is no such API in JDK, on
which the code will be run.

  Use the radio buttons below to forbid API usages respecting to project language level settings or custom
