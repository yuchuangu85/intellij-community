Reports any calls to overridable methods of the current class during object construction.
A call is during object construction if it is inside:
<ul>
  <li>A Constructor</li>
  <li>A Non-static instance initializer</li>
  <li>A Non-static field initializer</li>
  <li><code>clone()</code></li>
  <li><code>readObject()</code></li>
  <li><code>readObjectNoData()</code></li>
</ul>
Methods are overridable if they are not declared <code>final</code>, <code>static</code> or <code>private</code>. Package local methods are
considered safe, even though they are overridable. Such calls may result in subtle bugs, as the object is not guaranteed to be initialized
before the method call occurs.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Parent {
    void someMethod() { }
  }

  class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
      someMethod();
    }
  }
</pre>

This inspection shares functionality with:
<ul>
  <li>Abstract method called during object construction inspection</li>
  <li>Overridden method called during object construction inspection</li>
</ul>
Only one inspection should be enabled at the same time to prevent duplicate warnings.
