Reports any references to static members which are statically imported and also qualified with
their containing class name. Such qualification is unnecessary and can be removed
because the elements are already statically imported.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  import static foo.Test.WIDTH;

  class Bar {
    void bar() {
      System.out.println(Test.WIDTH);
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  import static foo.Test.WIDTH;

  class Bar {
    void bar() {
      System.out.println(WIDTH);
    }
  }
</pre>
