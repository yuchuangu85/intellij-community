Reports classes whose names are either too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern.
<p><b>Example:</b> if the inspection is enabled for tests and specifies the min class name length 8 (the default) the following test class
  <code>public class MyTest{}</code> produces a warning because the length of it's name is 6 which is less than 8.
<p>Quick-fix to rename the class is suggested only in the editor.</p>

  Use the list below to specify which classes should be checked. When the checkbox for the class type is unchecked, checks for this kind of classes are skipped. 
  For each class type use the fields to specify minimum length, maximum length and regular expression expected for class names.
Specify <b>0</b> in length fields to skip corresponding checks. Regular expressions are in standard <b>java.util.regex</b> format.
