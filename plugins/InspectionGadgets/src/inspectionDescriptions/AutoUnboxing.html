Reports expressions which are affected by unboxing conversion, the automatic unwrapping of objects into primitive values.
Don't use objects instead of primitives in hot code when possible. It may significantly affect the performance.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  int x = new Integer(42);
</pre>
<p>The quick-fix makes the conversion explicit:</p>
<pre>
  int x = new Integer(42).intValue();
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Autoboxing conversion is not supported under Java 1.4 or earlier JVMs.</p>
