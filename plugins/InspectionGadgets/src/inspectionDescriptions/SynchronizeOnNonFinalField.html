Reports the <code>synchronized</code> statements where the lock expression
is a reference to a non-<code>final</code> field. Such statements are unlikely to have useful semantics, as different
threads may be locking on different objects even when operating on the same object.

<pre>
  private Object o;
    public void foo() {
        synchronized (o) // synchronization on a non-final field
        { }
    }
