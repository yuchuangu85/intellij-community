Reports any uses of another object's <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code> fields. Java
allows the use of such fields for objects of the same class as the current objects, but
some coding styles discourage this use. Additionally, such direct access to <code>private</code> fields
may fail in component-oriented architectures such (e.g. Spring, Hibernate) which expect all access
to other objects to be through method calls so as to allow the framework to mediate all access
using proxies.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
public class Base {
    protected int bar;

    class Inside {
        int f(Base base) {
            return base.bar;  // warning: direct access to non-public field
        }
    }
}

class SomewhereElse {
    void m(Base base) {
        base.bar = 1; // warning: direct access to non-public field
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore accesses from the same class and only report accesses
from inner or outer classes.
  To ignore accesses from inner classes also, use the nested checkbox.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore accesses from an <code>equals()</code> method.
