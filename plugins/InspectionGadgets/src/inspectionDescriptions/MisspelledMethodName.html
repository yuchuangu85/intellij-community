Reports on cases where multiple methods of a class have names which differ only by
case. Such method names may be very confusing.
<p><b>Example:</b> <pre>
  <code>
    public int hashcode() {//reported, should be hashCode probably?
       return 0;
    }
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Quick-fix to rename the method is suggested only in the editor.</p>
