Reports fields whose names are either too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern.
<p><b>Example:</b> if the inspection is enabled constants and specifies the min field name length 5 (the default) the following constant
  <code>public static final int MAX = 42;</code> produces a warning because the length of it's name is 3 which is less than 5.
<p>Quick-fix to rename the field is suggested only in the editor.</p>

  Use the list below to specify which fields should be checked. When the checkbox for the field type is unchecked, checks for this kind of fields are skipped.
  For each field type use the fields to specify minimum length, maximum length and regular expression expected for class names.
  Specify <b>0</b> in length fields to skip corresponding checks. Regular expressions are in standard <b>java.util.regex</b> format.
