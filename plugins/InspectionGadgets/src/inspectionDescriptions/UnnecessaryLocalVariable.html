Reports unnecessary local variables, which add nothing to the comprehensibility of a method.
Variables caught include local variables which are immediately returned,
local variables that are immediately assigned to another variable and then not used,
and local variables which always have the same value as another local variable or parameter.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  boolean yes() {
    boolean b = true;
    return b;
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  boolean yes() {
    return true;
  }
</pre>

  Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection ignore immediately returned or thrown variables.
  Some coding styles suggest using such variables for clarity and ease of debugging.
