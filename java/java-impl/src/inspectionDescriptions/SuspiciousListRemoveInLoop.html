Reports <code>list.remove(index)</code> calls inside an ascending counted loop. This is suspicious as the list becomes
shorter after a remove, and the element after a removed element will not be processed. A simple fix is to decrease the index variable after a removal,
but probably removing via an iterator or using the <code>removeIf()</code> method (since Java 8) is a more robust alternative.
If you don't expect that <code>remove()</code> will be called more than once in a loop, consider adding a <code>break</code> after it.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    process(new ArrayList&lt;>(
      Arrays.asList("1", "2", "|", "3", "4")));
  }

  static void process(List&lt;String&gt; list) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
      if (list.get(i).equals("|")) {
        list.remove(i);
        continue;
      }
      System.out.println(list.get(i));
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Here we could expect that '1 2 3 4' will be printed, but 3 will be skipped in the output.</p>
