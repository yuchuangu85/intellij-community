Reports calls to <code>java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement()</code>, <code>java.sql.Connection.prepareCall()</code>, or any of their
variants, which take a dynamically-constructed string as the statement to prepare. Constructed SQL statements are a common source of
security breaches. By default this inspection ignores compile-time constants.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  String bar() { return "bar"; }

  Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("", "", "");
  connection.("SELECT * FROM user WHERE name='" + bar() + "'");
</pre>

Use the checkbox below to consider any <code>static</code> <code>final</code> fields as constants. Be careful, because strings like the
following will be ignored when the option is enabled:
<pre>
  static final String SQL = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE name='" + getUserInput() + "'";
</pre>
