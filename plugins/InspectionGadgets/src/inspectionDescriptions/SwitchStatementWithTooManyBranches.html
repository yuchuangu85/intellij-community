Reports <code>switch</code> statements/expressions with too many <code>case</code> labels.
Such a long switch statement may be confusing and should probably be refactored.
Sometimes it is not a problem (for example, domain is very complicated and has enums with a lot of constants).
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
    switch (x) {
        case 1 -> {}
        case 2 -> {}
        case 3 -> {}
        case 4 -> {}
        case 5 -> {}
        case 6 -> {}
        case 7 -> {}
        case 8 -> {}
        case 9 -> {}
        case 10 -> {}
        case 11,12,13 -> {}
        default -> {}
    }
</pre>
