Reports on any call to <code>wait()</code> not made inside a loop. <code>wait()</code> is normally
used to suspend a thread until a condition is true.
Because the thread could have been waken up for a different reason, that condition should be checked after the <code>wait()</code>
returns. A loop is a simple way to achieve this.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  <b>class</b> BoundedCounter {
    <b>private int</b> count;
    <b>synchronized void</b> inc() <b>throws</b> InterruptedException {
      // condition not checked after wake-up
      <b>if</b> (count >= 10) wait();
      ++count;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
