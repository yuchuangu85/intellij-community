Reports any attempts to reflectively check for the presence of an
annotation which is not defined as being retained at runtime.
Using <code>Class.isAnnotationPresent()</code> to test for an annotation
which has source retention or class-file retention (the default) will always result in a negative result,
but is easy to do inadvertently.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  { 
    getClass().isAnnotationPresent(SourceAnnotation.class); //always false
  }
  
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)
  @interface SourceAnnotation {}
</pre>
