Reports <code>Object.notify()</code> or <code>Object.notifyAll()</code> being called without any detectable state change occurring.
Normally, <code>Object.notify()</code> and <code>Object.notifyAll()</code> are used to inform other threads that a state change has
occurred. That state change should occur in a synchronized context that contains the <code>Object.notify()</code> or
<code>Object.notifyAll()</code> call, and prior to the call. While not having such a state change isn't necessarily incorrect, it is
certainly worth examining.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  synchronized (this) {
    notify();
  }
  // no state change
  synchronized (this) {
    notify(); // this notify might be redundant
  }
</pre>
