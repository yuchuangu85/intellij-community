Reports JUnit 4 <code>@Before</code> or <code>@After</code> methods which are not declared <code>public</code>, do not return
<code>void</code>, or take arguments, and suggests fixing the method signature. Such methods are easy to create inadvertently, but will not
be executed by JUnit tests runners.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  @Before private int foo(int arg) { ... }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  @Before public void foo() { ... }
</pre>
