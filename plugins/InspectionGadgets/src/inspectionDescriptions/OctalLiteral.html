Reports octal integer literals. Some coding standards prohibit the
use of octal literals, as they may be easily confused with decimal literals.
<p>Example:
<pre>
  int i = 015;
  int j = 0_777;
</pre>
<p>This inspection has two different quick fixes which may applied.
After the "Convert octal literal to decimal literal" quick fix is applied the result looks like:
<pre>
  int i = 13;
  int j = 511;
</pre>
Or after the "Remove leading zero to make decimal" quick fix is applied the result looks like:
<pre>
  int i = 15;
  int j = 777;
</pre>
