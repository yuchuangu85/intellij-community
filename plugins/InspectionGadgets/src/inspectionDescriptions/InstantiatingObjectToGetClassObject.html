Reports cases where new objects are instantiated for the purpose
of accessing its class object. It is more performant to access the class object
directly by name.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  Class&lt;?&gt; c = new Sample().getClass();
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  Class&lt;?&gt; c = Sample.class;
</pre>
