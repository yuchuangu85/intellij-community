Reports any variable declarations which can be moved to a smaller scope. Especially
useful for <i>Pascal style</i> declarations at the start of a method, but variables with too broad
a scope are also often left over after refactorings.
<p>Example of <code>sb</code> movement:</p>
<pre>
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
  System.out.println();
  sb.append(1);
</pre>
<p>After quick-fix is applied, the result will be:</p>
<pre>
  System.out.println();
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
  sb.append(1);
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to only report variables that can be moved inside deeper code blocks.
For example, when the checkbox is checked, the movement will be suggested for <code>sb</code> variable but not in the example above:
</p>
<pre>
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(a);
  if (flag) {
    sb.append(1);
  }
</pre>
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to report variables which are initialized
with a new expression. This makes the inspection potentially unsafe in cases where the
constructor has non-local side-effects.
For example, when the checkbox is checked, the movement will be suggested for <code>foo</code> variable:
</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    static List&lt;Foo&gt; fooList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    String bar;

    Foo(String bar) {
        this.bar = bar;
        fooList.add(this);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Foo foo = new Foo("bar"); // the movement is possible even though is unsafe
      System.out.println(fooList.size());
      System.out.println(foo.bar);
    }
  }
</pre>
