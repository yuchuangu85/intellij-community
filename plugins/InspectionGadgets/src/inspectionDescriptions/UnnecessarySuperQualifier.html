Reports any unnecessary uses of the <code>super</code>
qualifier in method calls and fields references. A super qualifier is unnecessary
when the field or method of the super class is not overridden in the calling class.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    void foo() {}
  }

  class Bar extends Foo {
    void bar() {
      super.foo();
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    void foo() {}
  }

  class Bar extends Foo {
    void bar() {
      foo();
    }
  }
</pre>

  Use the checkbox below to ignore qualifiers, which help to distinguish super members access
  from the same named members of the outer class.
