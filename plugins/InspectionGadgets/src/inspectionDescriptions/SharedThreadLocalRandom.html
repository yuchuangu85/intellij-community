Reports <code>java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom</code> instances which might be shared between threads.
<p>
  A <code>ThreadLocalRandom</code> might be shared between threads and is reported when it is assigned to a field,
  used as a method argument or assigned to a local variable and used in anonymous or nested classes.
  A <code>ThreadLocalRandom</code> should not be shared between threads because that is not thread-safe.
</p>
<p>
  Usages of <code>ThreadLocalRandom</code> should typically look like <code>ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(...)</code>
  (or <code>nextDouble(...)</code> etc.).
  When all usages are in this form, <code>ThreadLocalRandom</code> instances can not be used accidentally by multiple threads.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Main {
    void f(ThreadLocalRandom r) {}

    void m() {
        f(ThreadLocalRandom.current());
    }
  }
</pre>

  Use the table below to specify methods that are safe to pass a <code>ThreadLocalRandom</code> to as an argument.
