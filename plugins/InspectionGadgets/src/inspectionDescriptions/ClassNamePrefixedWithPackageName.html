Reports classes whose names are prefixed with their package names, ignoring differences in the
capitalization. While occasionally reasonable, this is often due to a poor naming scheme, and may be redundant and
annoying.
<p><b>Example:</b>
  <pre><code>
  package byteCode;
  class ByteCodeAnalyzer {}
</code></pre>
<p>Quick-fix to rename the class is suggested only in the editor.</p>
