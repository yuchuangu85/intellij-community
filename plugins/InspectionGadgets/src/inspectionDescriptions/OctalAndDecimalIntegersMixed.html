Reports mixed octal and decimal integer literals in a single array initializer.
This is often due to copying a list of numbers into an array initializer, where
some of the numbers in the array are zero-padded, and will thus be interpreted by the Java compiler as octal.
<p><b>Example:</b> <code>int[] elapsed = {1, 13, 052};</code></p>
<p>After the quick-fix to remove leading zero is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<code>int[] elapsed = {1, 13, 52};</code>

<p>If it was an octal number (e.g., after variable inline), then another quick-fix to convert octal to decimal is more appropriate, the result looks like this:</p>
<code>int[] elapsed = {1, 13, 42};</code>
