Reports <code>static</code> variables which are read prior to initialization. Equality checks with <code>null</code> are ignored by this
inspection.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    public static int bar;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println(bar);
    }
  }
</pre>
Note: this inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report static variables
used uninitialized incorrectly. Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.
