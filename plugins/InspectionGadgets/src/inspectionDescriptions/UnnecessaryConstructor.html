Reports unnecessary constructors.
A constructor is unnecessary if it is the only constructor of a class, has no parameters,
has the same access modifiers as its containing class,
and does not perform any initialization except explicitly or implicitly calling the super class constructor without arguments.
Such a constructor can be safely removed as it will be generated by the compiler even if not specified.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  public class Foo { public Foo() {} }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  public class Foo {}
</pre>
