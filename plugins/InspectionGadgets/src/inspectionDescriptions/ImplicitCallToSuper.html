Reports constructors which do not begin with calls to "super" constructor, or
other constructors of the same class. Such constructors can be thought of as implicitly beginning with a
call to <code>super()</code>. Some coding standards prefer that such calls to
<code>super()</code> be made explicitly.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    Foo() {}
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    Foo() {
      super();
    }
  }
</pre>

  Use the checkbox below to ignore classes not extending another class.
  For instance:
</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    Foo() {} // Not reported
  }

  class Bar extends Foo {
    Bar() {} // Implicit call to 'super()'
  }
</pre>
