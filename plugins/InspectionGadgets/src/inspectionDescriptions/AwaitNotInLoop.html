Reports on any call to <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition.await()</code> not made inside a loop.
<code>await()</code> and related methods are normally used to suspend a thread until a condition is signalled as true, 
and that condition should be checked after the <code>await()</code> returns. A loop is the clearest way to achieve this.
<p>Example: </p> <code>void acquire(Condition released) { released.await();} </code>
<p>
Good code should like this:
<pre><code>void acquire(Condition released) {
  while (acquired) {
    released.await();
  }
}</code></pre>
