Reports instantiations of <code>Throwable</code> and subclasses, where the created <code>Throwable</code>
is never actually thrown. Also reports method calls which return <code>Throwable</code> instances,
where the result of the method call is not thrown. These are simple mistakes to make which
are hard to catch in tests.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
    void leftBehind() throws Throwable {
        RuntimeException e = new RuntimeException("throw me");
        // ...
    }
</pre>
