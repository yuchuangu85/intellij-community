Reports static field accesses where the call is qualified by a subclass of the declaring class, rather than the declaring class itself. Java
allows such qualification, but such accesses may be confusing, and may indicate a subtle confusion of inheritance and overriding.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Parent {
    static int foo = 0;
  }

  class Child extends Parent { }

  void bar() {
    System.out.println(Child.foo);
  }
</pre>
