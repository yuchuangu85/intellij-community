Reports any calls to <code>Thread.stop()</code>,
<code>Thread.suspend()</code>, or <code>Thread.resume()</code>.
These calls are inherently prone to data corruption and deadlock, and their use is strongly
discouraged. It is better to use cooperative cancellation instead of <code>stop</code> and
interruption instead of direct use of <code>suspend</code> and <code>resume</code>.
