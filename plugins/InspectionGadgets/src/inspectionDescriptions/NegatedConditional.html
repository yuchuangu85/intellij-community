Reports conditional expressions whose conditions are negated.
Flipping the order of the conditional expression branches will usually increase the clarity of such statements.

<p>
  Use the checkboxes below to ignore comparisons of the form <code>obj != null</code> or <code>num != 0</code>.
  Since <code>obj != null</code> effectively means "obj exists",
  the meaning of the whole expression does not involve any negation
  and is therefore easy to understand.
<p>
  The same reasoning applies to <code>num != 0</code> expressions, especially when using bit masks.
<p>
  These forms have the added benefit of mentioning the interesting case first.
  In most cases, the value for the <code>== null</code> branch is <code>null</code> itself,
  like in the following examples:

<pre>
    static String getName(Person p) {
        return p != null ? p.getName() : null;
    }

    static String getExecutableString(int fileMode) {
        return (fileMode & 0b001001001) != 0 ? "executable" : "non-executable";
    }
</pre>
