Reports any string literal containing an octal escape sequence immediately followed by
a digit. Such strings may be confusing, and are often the result of errors in escape code creation.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  System.out.println("\1234"); // Octal escape sequence '\123' immediately followed by a digit
</pre>
