Reports any anonymous classes which may safely be replaced with a static inner classes.
An anonymous class may be a static inner class if it doesn't explicitly reference its enclosing instance or local classes from its surrounding method.
<p>
A static inner class does not keep an implicit reference to its enclosing instance.
This prevents a common cause of memory leaks and uses less memory per instance of the class.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  void sample(){
    Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
      }
    });
  }
</pre>
<p>The quick-fix extracts anonymous class into a named static inner class:</p>
<pre>
  void sample(){
    Thread thread = new Thread(new Task());
  }

  private static class Task implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
    }
  }
</pre>
