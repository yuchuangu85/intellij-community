Reports methods whose names are either too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern. Instance methods that override library
methods and constructors are ignored by this inspection.
<p><b>Example:</b> if the inspection is enabled for static methods and specifies the min method name length 4 (the default), the following static method
  <code>public static int max(int a, int b)</code> produces a warning because the length of its name is 3 which is less than 4.
<p>Quick-fix to rename the method is suggested only in the editor.</p>

  Use the list below to specify which methods should be checked. When the checkbox for the method type is unchecked, checks for this kind of methods are skipped.
  For each type use the fields to specify minimum length, maximum length and regular expression expected for method names.
  Specify <b>0</b> in length fields to skip corresponding checks. Regular expressions are in standard <b>java.util.regex</b> format.
