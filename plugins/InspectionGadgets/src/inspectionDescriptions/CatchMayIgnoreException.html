Reports <code>catch</code> blocks which are empty or may ignore exception.
While occasionally intended, empty <code>catch</code> blocks can make debugging extremely difficult.
Also ignoring catch parameter could be wrong. Finally it will be reported if it's statically detected
that catch block may silently ignore important VM exceptions like <code>NullPointerException</code>. Ignoring such exception
(without logging or rethrowing it) may hide a bug.
<p>
  This inspection will not report any <code>catch</code> parameters named "ignore" or "ignored".
  Conversely this inspection will warn on any <code>catch</code> parameters named "ignore" or "ignored" that are actually used.
  Also <code>catch</code> parameters named "expected" or "ok" are not reported inside test sources.
</p>
<p>
  You can use a quick fix to change the name of the exception to "ignored".
  For empty <b>catch</b> blocks an additional fix to generate the <b>catch</b> body is suggested.
  You can modify the "Catch Statement Body" template in
  <a href="settings://fileTemplates">Settings | Editor | File and Code Templates</a> (see the "Code" tab).
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  try {
    throwingMethod();
  } catch (IOException ex) {

  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  try {
    System.out.println(System.in.read());
  } catch (IOException ignored) {

  }
</pre>

<p>Use second checkbox to ignore <code>catch</code> that contains statements or comments inside while the variable itself is not used.</p>
<p>Use a third checkbox to ignore variables named <code>ignored</code>if they are still used.</p>
