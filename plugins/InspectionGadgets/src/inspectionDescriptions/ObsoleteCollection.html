Reports any uses of <code>java.util.Vector</code>, <code>java.util.Hashtable</code> and <code>java.util.Stack</code>.
Usages of these classes can most often be replaced by usages of
<code>java.util.ArrayList</code>, <code>java.util.HashMap</code> and <code>java.util.ArrayDeque</code> respectively.
While still supported,
the former classes were made obsolete by the JDK1.2 collection classes, and should probably
not be used in new development.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore any cases where the obsolete collections are used
as an argument to a method or assigned to a variable that requires the obsolete type.
Enabling this option is potentially quite processor intensive.
