Reports methods which must either recurse infinitely or throw an exception. Methods reported by this inspection can not return normally.
Though such can be written intentionally, in many cases it may be an overseen mistake.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  int baz() {
      return baz();
  }</code></pre>
