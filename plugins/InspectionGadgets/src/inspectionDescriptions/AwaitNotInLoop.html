Reports on any call to <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition.await()</code> not made inside a loop.
<code>await()</code> and related methods are normally used to suspend a thread until a condition is signalled as true, 
and that condition should be checked after the <code>await()</code> returns. A loop is the clearest way to achieve this.
<p>Example:</p><pre>
<code>void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException { 
  released.await();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Good code should look like this:
<pre><code>void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException {
  while (acquired) {
    released.await();
  }
}</code></pre>
