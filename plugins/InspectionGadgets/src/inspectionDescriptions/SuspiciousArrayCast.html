Reports suspicious array casts. An array cast is suspicious when it casts to a more specific array type. Such a cast is legal at compile
time but may fail with a <code>ClassCastException</code> at runtime.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  Number[] numbers = new Number[]{1L, 2L, 4L};
  Long[] longs = (Long[])numbers;
</pre>
