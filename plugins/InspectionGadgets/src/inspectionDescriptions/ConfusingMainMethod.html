Reports methods named "main" which do not have signature
public static void main(String[]). Such methods may be confusing, as methods named "main"
are expected to be application entry points.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Main {
    void main(String[] args) {} //a warning here because there are no "public static" modifiers
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix to rename the method is suggested only in the editor.</p>
