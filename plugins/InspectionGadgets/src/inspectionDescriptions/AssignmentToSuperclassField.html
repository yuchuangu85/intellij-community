Reports any assignments to fields declared in a superclass from within a constructor.
It is usually better to initialize superclass fields in its own constructor and
delegate to that constructor in a subclass. This will also allow to declare the field as final,
if it's not changed after the construction.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
class Super {
  int x;
}
class Sub extends Super {
  Sub(int _x) {
    // Warning: x is declared in a superclass
    x = _x;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>To avoid this problem, declare a super-class constructor:</p>
<pre>
class Super {
  final int x;

  Super(int _x) {
    x = _x;
  }
}
class Sub extends Super {
  Sub(int _x) {
    super(_x);
  }
}
</pre>
