Reports <code>clone()</code> methods that have a return type that differs from the class they are located in.
Often a <code>clone()</code> method will have a return type of <code>java.lang.Object</code>, which makes it harder to use by its clients.
<i>Effective Java</i> (second and third edition) recommends that the return type of the <code>clone()</code> method should be
the class type of the object it returns.
<p>Example:
<pre>
  <b>class</b> Foo <b>implements</b> Cloneable {
    <b>public</b> Object clone() {
      <b>try</b> {
        super.clone();
      } <b>catch</b> (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
        <b>throw new</b> AssertionError();
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
