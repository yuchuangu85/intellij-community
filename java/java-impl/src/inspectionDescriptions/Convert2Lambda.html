Reports anonymous classes which can be replaced with lambda expressions.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  new Thread(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
      // run thread
    }
  });
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  new Thread(() -> {
    // run thread
  });
</pre>
<p>
Note that if an anonymous class is converted into a stateless lambda, the same lambda object
can be reused by Java runtime during subsequent invocations. On the other hand, when an anonymous class is used,
separate objects are created every time. Thus, applying the quick-fix can cause the semantics change in rare cases,
e.g. when anonymous class instances are used as <code>HashMap</code> keys.
</p>
<p>Lambda syntax is not supported under Java 1.7 or earlier JVMs.</p>

Configure the checkbox below to ignore cases when the anonymous class implements an
interface without <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> annotation.
