Reports calls to <code>Object.finalize()</code>. Calling
<code>Object.finalize()</code> explicitly is a bad idea, as it can result in objects being placed in an
inconsistent state.
This method is automatically called by the garbage collector on an object when it determines that there are no more references to the object.
Calls to <code>super.finalize()</code> from within implementations of <code>finalize()</code>
are benign, and are not reported by this inspection.
<p>Example:
<pre>
  MyObject m = new MyObject();
  m.finalize();
  System.gc()
</pre>
