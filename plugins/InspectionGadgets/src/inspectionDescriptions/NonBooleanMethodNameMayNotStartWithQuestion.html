Reports non-boolean methods whose names start with a question
word. Non-boolean methods that override library methods are ignored by this inspection.
Such method names may be confusing.
<p><b>Example:</b> <pre>
  <code>public void hasName(String name) { assert names.contains(name); }</code>
</pre>
<p>Quick-fix to rename the method is suggested only in the editor.</p>
