Reports reflective access to fields and methods which don't exist or aren't visible.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  Field stringHashField() throws NoSuchFieldException {
    return String.class.getField("hash");
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  Field stringHashField() throws NoSuchFieldException {
    return String.class.getDeclaredField("hash");
  }
</pre>

<p>
  With a <code>final</code> class it's clear if there's a field or method with the specified name in the class.
</p>
<p>
  With non-<code>final</code> classes it's possible that a subclass has a field or method with that name, so there could be false positives.
  You may use the inspection settings to get rid of such false positives, everywhere or with specific classes.
