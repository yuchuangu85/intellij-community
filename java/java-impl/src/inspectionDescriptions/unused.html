Reports classes, methods or fields in the specified inspection scope that are not used or not reachable from entry points.
Examples of entry points: main method, tests, classes mentioned outside the specified scope, classes accessible from
<code>module-info.java</code> etc. It's also possible to configure custom entry points by name patterns or annotations.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>public class Department {
   private Organization myOrganization;
}</code></pre>
Here <code>Department</code> explicitly references <code>Organization</code> but if <code>Department</code> class itself is unused, 
then inspection would report both classes. 

<p>
  The inspection also reports parameters which are not used by their methods and all method implementations/overriders, as well as local
  variables which are declared but not used.
</p>
<p>
  <b>NOTE:</b> Some unused members might not be reported during in-editor highlighting. Due to performance reasons, a non-private member is
  checked only when it's name rarely occurs in the project.
  To see all results, please run the inspection using Analyze | Inspect Code... or Analyze | Run Inspection by Name...
</p>

<!-- tooltip end -->
Use visibility settings below to configure what members should be reported, e.g., configuring report <code>private</code> methods only means
that <code>public</code> methods of <code>private</code> inner class would be reported but <code>protected</code> methods of top level class
would be ignored.

<p>
  Use <b>entry points</b> tab to configure which entry points should be considered during inspection run.
  You will also have a possibility to add entry points manually when inspection results are ready.
  <br/>
  If your code uses unsupported framework and this framework:
<ul>
  <li>
    rely on annotations, then use 'Annotations...' button to configure framework's annotations.
  </li>
  <li>
    doesn't rely on annotations, then try to configure class name patterns which are expected by the framework.
  </li>
</ul>
This way annotated code which is accessible by the framework internals would be treated as used.
