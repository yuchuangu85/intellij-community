Reports usages of classes in a field or method signatures when a class containing in a signature is less visible than the member itself.
While legal Java, such members are useless outside of the visibility scope.
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>public</code> method which returns a <code>private</code> inner <code>class</code></li>
  <li><code>protected</code> field whose type is a package-local <code>class</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
In Java 9 a module may hide some of its classes by excluding their packages from export.
So if the signature of exported API contains a non-exported class, such API is useless outside of the module.
