Reports any references to inner classes which are unnecessarily qualified with the name
of the enclosing class. Such qualification is unnecessary, and may be safely removed. This may
require the addition of an import for the inner class.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class X {
     X.Y foo;
     class Y{}
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  class X {
     Y foo;
     class Y{}
  }
</pre>

Use the checkbox below to ignore references to inner classes where the removal of the qualification
would require the addition of an import.
