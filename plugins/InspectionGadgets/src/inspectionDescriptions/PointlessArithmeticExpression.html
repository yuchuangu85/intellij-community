Reports pointless arithmetic expressions. Such expressions include adding or subtracting zero,
multiplying by zero or one and division by one.
<p>
  Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings not completely followed through
  to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer intended to do.
</p>
<p>The quick-fix simplifies such expressions.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  void f(int a) {
    int x = a - a;
    int y = a + 0;
    int res = x / x;
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  void f(int a) {
    int x = 0;
    int y = a;
    int res = 1;
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Note that in rare cases, the suggested replacement might not be completely equivalent of the original code
  for all possible inputs. E.g. the inspection suggests to replace <code>x / x</code> with <code>1</code>.
  However, if <code>x</code> happens to be zero, the original code throws <code>ArithmeticException</code> or results in <code>NaN</code>.
  Also, if <code>x</code> is <code>NaN</code>, then the result is also <code>NaN</code>. It's very unlikely that such a behavior is
  intended.
