  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
  Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
</p>
Reports any calls to <code>String.startsWith()</code> or
<code>String.endsWith()</code> which are passed single character string
literals as parameter.
<p>There is a fix that replace such calls with more efficiently implemented <code>String.charAt()</code>.</p>
Because the performance gain is minimal, the needed extra check for non-zero length, and the negative effect on
code clarity, it is recommended to do so only inside tight loops.
<p>Example</p>
<pre>
  boolean startsWithX(String s) {
    return s.startsWith("x");
  }
</pre>
<p>After applying the fix:</p>
<pre>
  boolean startsWithX(String s) {
    return !s.isEmpty() && s.charAt(0) == 'x';
  }
</pre>
