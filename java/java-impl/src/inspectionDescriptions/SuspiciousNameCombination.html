<body>
Reports assignments and function calls where the name of the target variable or the function parameter does not match the name of the value assigned to it.
<p>Example:
<pre>
  <b>int</b> x = 0;
  <b>int</b> y = x; // x is used as a y-coordinate
</pre>
or
<pre><code>
  <b>int</b> x = 0, y = 0;
  // x is used as a y-coordinate and y as an x-coordinate
  Rectangle rc = <b>new</b> Rectangle(y, x, 20, 20);
</code></pre>

<p>The first panel below allows to specify the names which should not be used together: an error is reported
if the parameter name or assignment target name contains words from one group and the name of the assigned or passed
variable contains words from a different group.
<p>The second panel below allows to specify methods that should not be checked but do have a potentially suspicious name.
For example the <code>Integer.compare()</code> parameters are named <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, but are unrelated to coordinates.
