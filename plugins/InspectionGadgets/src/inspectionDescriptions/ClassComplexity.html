Reports classes with too high of a total complexity. The
total complexity of a class is the sum of the cyclomatic complexities of all the methods
and initializers the class declares. Inherited methods and initializers are not counted
toward the total complexity. When a class becomes too complex it could be a sign that
the refactoring to several smaller classes is desired.
