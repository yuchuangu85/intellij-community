Reports exceptions that are declared in a method's signature but never thrown by the method itself or its implementations/derivatives.
 Inspection ignores methods related to the serialization, for example methods <code>readObject()</code> or <code>writeObject()</code>.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  void method() throws InterruptedException {
    System.out.println();
  }
</pre>
<p>The quick-fix removes unnecessary exceptions from the declaration and normalizes the redundant <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> statements:</p>
<pre>
  void method() {
    System.out.println();
  }
</pre>
<p>
  <b>NOTE:</b> Some exceptions might not be reported during in-editor highlighting. Due to performance reasons, a non-private method is
  checked only when it's name rarely occurs in the project.
  To see all results, please run the inspection using Analyze | Inspect Code... or Analyze | Run Inspection by Name...
