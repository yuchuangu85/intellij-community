Reports return statements at the end of closures which can be made implicit.
Groovy closures implicitly return the value of the last statement in them.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
def foo = {
  return 1
}
</pre>

<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
def foo = {
  1
}
</pre>
