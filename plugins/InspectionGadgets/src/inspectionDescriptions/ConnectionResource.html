Reports any Java ME <code>javax.microedition.io.Connection</code> resource which is not opened in front of a <code>try</code> block and
closed in the corresponding <code>finally</code> block. Such resources may be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the
resource is closed.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  void example() throws IOException {
    Connection c = Connector.open("foo");
  }
</pre>
