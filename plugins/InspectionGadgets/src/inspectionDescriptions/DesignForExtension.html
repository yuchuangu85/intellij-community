Reports any methods which are not <code>static</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>final</code> or <code>abstract</code>, and whose bodies
are not empty. Coding in a style that avoids such methods protects the contracts of classes from being broken by their subclasses. The
benefit of this style is that subclasses cannot corrupt the state of the superclass by forgetting to call the super method. The cost is that
subclasses are limited in their flexibility, in particular they cannot prevent execution of code in the superclass.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Foo {
    public boolean equals(Object o) { return true; } // non-final declaration
  }
</pre>

This inspection is intended for code to be used in secure environments, and is probably not appropriate for less restrictive environments.
