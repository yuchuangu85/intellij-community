Reports <code>throw</code> statements whose exceptions are always
caught by containing <code>try</code> statements. Using <code>throw</code>
statements as a "goto" to change the local flow of control is both confusing and likely to have poor performance.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  try {
    if (!Files.isDirectory(PROJECTS)) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Directory not found."); // warning: 'throw' caught by containing 'try' statement
    }
    ...
  }
  catch (Exception e) {
      LOG.error("run failed");
  }
</pre>
