Reports any methods which override a concrete method,
but which do not call that method as <code>super</code>. This is also known as a <i>refused bequest</i> and such methods
may represent a failure of abstraction which can lead to hard-to-trace bugs. Default methods and methods overridden
from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, except for <code>clone()</code>, are not reported by this inspection.
A <code>clone()</code> method is expected to call its super, which will automatically return an object of the correct type.
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><pre>
  class A {
    @Override
    public Object clone() { // reported, because it does not call 'super.clone()'
      return new A();
    }
  }
  </pre> </li>
  <li><pre>
  interface I {
    default void foo() {}
  }

  class A implements I {
    // warning on method when 'Ignore 'default' super methods' and 'Ignore annotated' options are disabled
    @Override
    public void foo(){}
  }
  </pre></li>
</ul>
