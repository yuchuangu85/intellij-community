Reports type cast expressions which are surrounded by an <code>instanceof</code> check for a different type.
While it is possible that this was intended, such a construct is most likely an error, and will
result in a <code>java.lang.ClassCastException</code> at runtime.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  int f(Object o){
    if (o instanceof String) {
      return (Integer) o;
    }
    return 0;
  }
</pre>
