Reports any uses of variables which are known to be constant. This
is the case if the (read) use of the variable is surrounded by an
<code>if</code>, <code>while</code> or <code>for</code>
statement with an <code>==</code> condition which compares the variable with a constant. In such
a case the use
of a variable which is known to be constant can be replaced with the actual constant.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
    private static void foo(double number) {
        if (number == 1.0) {
            f(number);
        }
    }
    private static void f(double number) {}
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre>
    private static void foo(double number) {
        if (number == 1.0) {
            f(1.0);
        }
    }
    private static void f(double number) {}
</pre>
