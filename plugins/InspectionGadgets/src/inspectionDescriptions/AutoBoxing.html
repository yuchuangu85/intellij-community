Reports expressions which are affected by autoboxing conversion, the automatic wrapping of primitive values as objects.
Don't use objects instead of primitives in hot code when possible. It may significantly affect the performance.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  Integer x = 42;
</pre>
<p>The quick-fix makes the conversion explicit:</p>
<pre>
  Integer x = Integer.valueOf(42);
</pre>

<p>Autoboxing conversion is not supported under Java 1.4 or earlier JVMs.</p>
