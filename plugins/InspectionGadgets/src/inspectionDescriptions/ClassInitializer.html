Reports any non-<code>static</code> initializers
in classes. Some coding standards prohibit instance initializers, preferring initialization to be done
in constructors or field initializers. Non-<code>static</code> initializers
may also be inadvertently created by deleting the <code>static</code> keyword,
resulting in obscure bugs.
This inspection does not warn on instance initializers in anonymous classes.

Use the checkbox below to ignore instance initializers in classes which do not have any constructors.
