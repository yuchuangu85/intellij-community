Reports any floating point numbers which do not have a decimal point, numbers before the decimal point,
and numbers after the decimal point. Such literals may be confusing, and violate several coding standards.
<p><b>Example:</b><code>double d = .03;</code></p>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<code>double d = 0.03;</code>
