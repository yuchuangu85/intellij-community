Reports cases when the right side of the assignment is a division that shouldn't be truncated to integer.
While occasionally intended, this construction is often buggy.
<p>
  For example, the following code doesn't change <code>x</code> because of the integer division result:
<pre>
  int x = 18;
  x *= 3/2;
</pre>
So, it should be replaced with:
<pre>
  int x = 18;
  x *= 3.0/2;
</pre>

<p>
    Use the checkbox below to disable inspection in cases of suspicious but possibly exact divisions e.g., if dividend can't be calculated statically 
<pre><code>
  void calc(int d) {
     int x = 18;
     x *= d/2;
  }
</code></pre>
