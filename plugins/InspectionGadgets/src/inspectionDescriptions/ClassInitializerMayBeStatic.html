Reports any class initializers which may safely be made <code>static</code>.
A class initializer may be static if it does not reference any of its class' non static methods
and non static fields. Static initializers are executed once when the class is resolved,
though non-static initializer are executed on each class instance creation.  
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  class A {
     public static String CONSTANT;
     {
        CONSTANT = "Hello";
     }
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quickfix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  class A {
     public static String CONSTANT;
     static {
        CONSTANT = "Hello"; //initialized now only once per class
     }
  }
</pre>
