Reports methods returning <code>this</code>.
While such a return is valid, it is rarely necessary, and usually indicates that the developer intends the method to be used
as part of a chain of similar method calls (e.g. <code>buffer.append("foo").append("bar").append("baz")</code>).
Such chains are frowned upon by many coding standards.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  public Builder append(String str) {
    // [...]
    return this;
  }
</pre>
