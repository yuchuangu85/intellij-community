Reports the Java code constructs that may fail to compile in future Java versions.
The following problems are reported:
<ul>
  <li>Use of 'assert', 'enum' or '_' as an identifier</li>
  <li>Use of restricted identifier 'var', 'yield', or 'record' as a type name</li>
  <li>Unqualified calls to method named 'yield'</li>
  <li>Modifiers on 'requires java.base' statement inside module-info.java</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  // Since Java 14, this class will stop compiling, as 'yield' becomes a restricted identifier.
  public class yield {} 
</pre>
<p>Fixing these issues timely may simplify migration to future Java versions.</p>
