Reports when a more specific commonly used class or interface could be extended or implemented, instead of the current one.
The super class needs to be located inside the project source files and
the project needs to use the IntelliJ IDEA build system for this inspection to work.
<p>Example:
<pre>
  class MyInheritor implements A {} // B suggested on the A reference

  interface A {}

  abstract class B implements A {}

  abstract class C1 extends B {}
  abstract class C2 extends B {}
  abstract class C3 extends B {}
  abstract class C4 extends B {}
  abstract class C5 extends B {}
</pre>

<p>By default this inspection does not highlight in the editor, but only provides a quick fix.
