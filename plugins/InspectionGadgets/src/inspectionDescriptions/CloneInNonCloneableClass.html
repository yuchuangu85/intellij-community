Reports classes which override the
<code>clone()</code> method, but which do not implement the <code>Cloneable</code> interface.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate if this inspection should only warn on <code>public</code> methods.
Classes designed for inheritance may choose to override <code>clone</code>() and declare it <code>protected</code>
without implementing <code>Cloneable</code> to give subclasses the choice to implement it.
