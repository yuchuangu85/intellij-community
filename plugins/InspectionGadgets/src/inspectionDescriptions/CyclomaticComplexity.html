Reports methods that have too high a cyclomatic complexity. Cyclomatic
complexity is a measurement of the number of branching points in a method. Methods with too high
cyclomatic complexity may be confusing and difficult to test.
<p>
A branch point is:
<ul>
  <li>loop statement</li>
  <li>if statement</li>
  <li>ternary expression</li>
  <li>catch section</li>
  <li>expression with one or more <code>&&</code> or <code>||</code> operators in it</li>
  <li>switch block with non-default branches</li>
</ul>
