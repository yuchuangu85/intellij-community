Reports methods which are highly coupled, i.e. that reference too many other classes.
Methods with too high coupling can be very fragile, and should probably be broken up.
<p>
Note: references to classes from <code>java</code>or <code>javax</code> packages are not counted as well as third-party libraries classes.
Note: every referenced class is counted only once no matter how many times it was referenced.
