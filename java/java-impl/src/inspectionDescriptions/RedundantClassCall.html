Reports redundant calls of <code>java.lang.Class</code> methods. E.g. <code>Xyz.class.isInstance(object)</code> could be replaced with <code>object instanceof Xyz</code>.
The instanceof check is preferred, even though the performance will probably be the same as these methods are intrinsics, they show more clear that it is a static check.
